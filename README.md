1.Developed a basic MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project, "AddUsers", that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user management.
2.Designed and implemented a MongoDB database schema to store user data, including user names and IDs.
3.Built a RESTful API using Express.js to handle user requests and interact with the MongoDB database, including endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.
4.Created a React.js frontend to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application, including a form to add new users and a table to display existing users.
5.Implemented CRUD operations using Axios to make HTTP requests to the backend API, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete users.
